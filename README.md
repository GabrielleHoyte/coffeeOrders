# House Cass Coffee House App

An app that enables the cashier to enter the customer's name and their order and then adds that order to a queue that the baristas can see and give them the ability to mark an order complete. Completed orders show which barista completed the order and have their own list

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node

## Optimizations:
If I return to this project, I'd really like to overhaul the CSS and make it a little more user friendly and accessible, particularly on the homepage where customers can put in their orders. It would be cool to add some pictures in case someone doesn't know what a particular drink looks like

## Lessons Learned:
This project reminded me to be conscious of both the client and server side of apps and how one setting on a client side page, can throw something off server side or vice versa if I'm not careful
